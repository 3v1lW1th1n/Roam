|name| is a field data collection application built using QGIS. It was built to be easy to use on (windows) based tablet devices, with Android planned for the future.

Custom forms are built using Qt Designer and follow a convention based approach in order to save configuration.  The general goal of |name| is to be datasource agnostic in most of what it does.  

Building
-------------

- QGIS 2.0 (installed using OSGeo4W)
- Qt Designer (part of the qt4-devel package)
- py2exe

See PACKAGE.txt for more details on building.
